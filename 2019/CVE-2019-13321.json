The specific flaw exists within the handling of HTTP responses to the Captive Portal. A crafted HTML response can cause the Captive Portal to to open a browser to a specified location without user interaction. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute code in the context of the current process. Was ZDI-CAN-7467."
