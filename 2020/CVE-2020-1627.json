By continuously sending the same specific packets, an attacker can repeatedly crash the riot process causing a sustained Denial of Service.\n\nFlow cache is specific to vMX based products and the MX150, and is enabled by default in performance mode.\n\nThis issue can only be triggered by traffic destined to the device.  Transit traffic will not cause the riot daemon to crash.\n\nWhen the issue occurs, a core dump and riot log file entry are generated.  For example:\n\n  \/var\/crash\/core.J-UKERN.mpc0.1557255993.3864.gz\n\n  \/home\/pfe\/RIOT logs:\n  fpc0 riot[1888]: PANIC in lu_reorder_send_packet_postproc():\n  fpc0 riot[6655]: PANIC in lu_reorder_send_packet_postproc():\n\nThis issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS:\n18.1 versions prior to 18.1R3 on vMX and MX150;\n18.2 versions prior to 18.2R3 on vMX and MX150;\n18.2X75 versions prior to 18.2X75-D60 on vMX and MX150;\n18.3 versions prior to 18.3R3 on vMX and MX150;\n18.4 versions prior to 18.4R2 on vMX and MX150;\n19.1 versions prior to 19.1R2 on vMX and MX150.\nThis issue does not affect Junos OS versions prior to 18.1R1.\n"
