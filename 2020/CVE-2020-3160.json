Other applications and processes are unaffected. The vulnerability is due to improper input validation of XMPP packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted XMPP packets to an affected device. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause process crashes and a DoS condition for XMPP conferencing applications."
