For guests for which \"active\" profiling was enabled by the administrator, the xenoprof code uses the standard Xen shared ring structure. Unfortunately, this code did not treat the guest as a potential adversary: it trusts the guest not to modify buffer size information or modify head \/ tail pointers in unexpected ways. This can crash the host (DoS). Privilege escalation cannot be ruled out."
