The attacker needs a valid developer account to exploit this vulnerability. The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation when processing received adaptive cards. The attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending an adaptive card with malicious content to an existing user of the Cisco Webex Teams client for Windows. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the targeted user's client to crash continuously."
